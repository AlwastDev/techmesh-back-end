# TechMesh Laws

## Scope / Focus
- Build vertical slices only (UI → API → DB → tests).
- One active milestone at a time.
- New feature ideas go to Parking Lot (no derail).

## Delivery
- Main branch stays green (tests passing).
- No large refactors without a failing test or a measured reason.
- If you want to rewrite, create a Spike issue first. Timebox it.

## Daily habits
- Always end a session with: a commit + a next-step note.
- If stuck > 20 minutes: write a note, create a tiny issue, switch to something smaller.

## Burnout prevention
- No late-night “hero sessions”.
- Stop when the timebox ends even if it’s unfinished (leave breadcrumbs).
- Prefer “small shipped progress” over “perfect architecture”.
